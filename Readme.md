JustTrustMe
===========

**Support Android 11**

An xposed module that disables SSL certificate checking.  This is useful for auditing an application which does certificate pinning.  There also exists a nice framework built by @moxie to aid in pinning certs in your app: [certificate pinning](https://github.com/moxie0/AndroidPinning). 

An example of an application that does cert pinning is [Twitter](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.twitter.android).  If you would like to view the network traffic for this application, you must disable the certificate pinning.

I built this for xposed rather than cydia substrate because xposed seems to support newer devices better. Marc Blanchou wrote the [original tool](https://github.com/iSECPartners/Android-SSL-TrustKiller) for cydia substrate.  If you find that you are not able to MITM an application please file an issue.

As a prequsite, your device must be rooted and the xposed framework must be installed.
